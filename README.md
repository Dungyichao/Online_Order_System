# Online Order System with React and Firebase
This project is to help a local restaurant in Columbia SC to provide online order service (because of COVID-19). We host the project on Google Firebase for free. I will summarize the design concept, code structure in this tutorial.

# 1. What is the Goal <br />
Let's first list out the requirement for an online order service: <br />
    * Public users can review the information and menu of the restaurant. They can sign up or sign in to their account. <br />
    * Registered customer can see the menu and place order. <br />
    * Boss can review customers' orders and change the status of each order. Boss can disable online order service. <br />
    
According to the above requirement, we can categorize our design into 6 catergories
