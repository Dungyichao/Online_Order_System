# Online Order System with React and Firebase
This project is to help a local restaurant in Columbia SC to provide online order service (because of COVID-19). We host the project on Google Firebase for free. I will summarize the design concept, code structure in this tutorial. The coding environment is in Ubuntu OS and Visual Studio Code IDE.

# 1. What is the Goal <br />
Let's list out the requirement for an online order service and the programming structure in the following. <br />

**1.1 Requirement**
* Public users can review the information and menu of the restaurant. They can sign up or sign in to their account.
* Registered customer can see the menu and place order.
* Boss can review customers' orders and change the status of each order. Boss can disable online order service.

**1.2 App Category**    
According to the above requirement, we can categorize our programming design into 6 catergories

**1.3 Final Result** <br />
Let's have a look at the final result. First one is the GIF of the regular customer demonstration. After the customer place the oder, he or she can view the order status in real time.

Second, the demonstration of boss view. There is a console for boss to review, edit, and search all the orders and their status.

# 2. Configuration <br />
Three major programming thing we need to deal with: React, Reac-bootstrap, Firebase Database. 

## 2.1 Install and Create React App Porject
```linux
$ sudo apt install curl
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x |sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm
$ sudo npm install npm@latest â€“g
// Create a project folder and then cd to that folder
$ npm init
$ npm start
// A React App Webpage will display
```
## 2.2 Host Project on Firebase
You first create project in Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/

```linux
$ npminstall -g firebase-tools
$ firebase login
//Use gmail account
//Go into React project folder
$ npm start
$ npm run-script build
$ firebase init
// Select: Database, Hosting, (Functions can be add later)
// Select: Use an existing project
// What do you want to use as your public directory? build
// Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
// File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? N
$ firebase deploy
// You now can visit the website from browser which URL that Firebase gave you.
```

# 3. Programming <br />
We are not going to dive into the code, but we will focus more on the concept (becuase you may find many useful tutorials guide you through the code and I will provide the link). Although this is a small project, it includes more than 60 files of codes, we need to archive them into folders. The following chart is the relationship of each folder and their corresponding function and web page. (Please click the image to enlarge for more clear view)

## 3.1 Firebase <br />
The firebase object is in code: ```Src/Firebase/firebase.js```. However, this object will be initialized and created in ```App.js``` and you should only create it once, and then pass this initialized object into other components for further usage. If you don't go through this manner, you are prone to get error like: ***you cannot initializeApp() more than once.***

Problem you might encounter: <br />
* A. ***Blank webpage after deploy hosting on Firebase***: You need to configure the ```firebase.json``` file (see ```Package_Rule/firebase.json```)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52177222/blank-page-after-successful-firebase-deployment
* B. ***Firebase App named DEFAULT already exists***: This error occurs when you trying to initialize firebase again and again. It should be initialized at once.
* C. ***FirebaseError: code=permission-denied: Missing or insufficient permissions***: add the following to your Database Rules tab
```json
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.1.1 Firebase Authentication <br />
A good tutorial can be start from here: https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial and https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.auth.Auth#signinwithemailandpassword. 

Notice that, cause we've initialize the firebase object, so when we call some function provided by firebase, the syntax might be little different from the official document.

## 3.2 React-router-dom <br />
React-router-dom can provide client user can be redirected without page reload. We use this in ```App.js```.
### 3.2.1 Protected Routes 
Actually, nothing is really protected on the client side, cause all your code are transmitting to client web browser for rendering. Nothing is protected. Protected Routh method can only prevent client from using some functions if they doesn't meet some criteria.
The following link: https://dev.to/mychal/protected-routes-with-react-function-components-dh shows you how to make protected route. You may find the implimentation in ```Src/App.js``` and ```Src/Components/ProtectedRoutes.js```.

## 3.3 React-bootstrap <br />
React-bootstrap provides so much great components such as menu bar, button, form, cards, tabs. They are beautiful and responsive.
Official site: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction
Problem you might encounter: <br />
* A. ***The react-bootstrap not working or showing as expected***: Add ```import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";``` in your index.js
* B. ***Increase Toast width***: Add style={{maxWidth: '100%'}}

## 3.4 React <br />
 

Problem you might encounter: <br />
* A. ***Each child in an array should have a unique "key" prop.***: When render component in map, you should do something like the following
```javascript
.......
render(){
    return(
        someObjectArray.map((item. idx) => {
            return(
            <div key={idx}>
                <Component data={item.datas} />
            </div>
            )
        })
    )
}
```
* B. ***React render the list not expected***: This is my own question asked on stack overflow. The problem is, the data in the array are correct (cart data), but after customer remove one item from the cart (object in array), the other data are not render correctly. Someone suggest me to use functional component if I don't need to keep tracking on its state. Finally, I found out that the root cause is during the time customer add the item to cart, I should clear the state of the ```Src/Customer/Order/Menu/DishItem.js``` after sending the data (object) to ```Src/Customer/Order/order.js``` (which hold the array of objects) and then pass it to ```Src/Customer/Order/Cart/CartItem.js``` for rendering.

## 3.5 Javascript <br />
### 3.5.1 Shallow Copy or Deep Clone
Please refer to the document for further knowledge: https://github.com/Dungyichao/Online_Order_System/blob/main/Ref/How%20to%20Deep%20Copy%20Objects%20and%20Arrays%20in%20JavaScript.pdf . <br />
We use lodash library's cloneDeep to performence deep copy of array in ```Src/Customer/Order/order.js```. In our example, the array will store objects which each object represents the item the customer added to the cart (the ```Src/Customer/Order/Cart/cart.js``` would render all the information provided by this array of objects). If customer add or remove any item from the cart (which also means the object in the aray), we need to first deep clone the original array, add or remove object from this new cloned array, then use```setState``` to replace the original array with the new modified array. If you don't use deep clone, the cart would not render as you expected. For example
```javascript
import _ from "lodash"
....
this.state = {
    Cart_data: [],
}
....
remove_item(e) {
        let { Cart_data } = this.state;

        const remove_item = Cart_data.filter((item) => item.uid === e);

        let deepcopy_list = _.cloneDeep(Cart_data);
        const newlist = deepcopy_list.filter((item) => item.uid !== e);
        this.setState({ Cart_data: newlist }, () => {
            //some callback
        });
    }

```
